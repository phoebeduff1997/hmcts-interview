A list of trade offs made while building this application

## Database
    For ease of local set up I have opted to use a local in memory database. This would usually be better served for
    integration tests, but to simulate a "live" environment the database is prepopulated with data on load

## Overdue scheduler
    I have set up a default async task executor to handle the Server Sent Event (SSE) implemented to return the updated
    overdue tasks. This has been set up with some small numbers as this is a demo only. If this was in production I
    would change out the spring MVC dependency for webflux, as MVC is a blocking thread and webflux isnt. I didnt want
    to engage in premature optimisation in a demo app

## Logging
    The spec document didnt ask for logging so for brevity I havent added any dedicated loggers. If this was local/small
    scale production code (e.g. a desktop app or a small internal tool) I would add a backend logger to log the backend
    errors, and I would configure the frontend error handler to send the logs to the backend and log for agregated error
    logging. If this was a live instance with many users, I would consider other tools like Sentry/Datadog/Elastic
    depending on requirements
